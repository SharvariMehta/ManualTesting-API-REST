## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates **end-to-end REST API Testing** on a sample hotel booking API.

👉 [Restful-Booker](https://restful-booker.herokuapp.com/apidoc/index.html)

It covers **CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update Full, Update Partial, Delete)** along with **Authentication, Negative Scenarios, Boundary Value Cases, and Performance Testing**.
The focus is to showcase **end-to-end API validation skills** using **Postman collections** and related test scenarios.

## 🚀 Features Covered

* 🔑 **Authentication & Security** – Token-based login, unauthorized access checks 
* 📖 **CRUD Operations** – Create, Get, Update (Full & Partial), Delete bookings 
* ❌ **Negative Scenarios** – Invalid IDs, invalid data types, missing fields 
* 📊 **Boundary Value Cases** – Large payloads, empty requests, special chars, high price values 
* ⚡ **Performance Testing** – Response time validation under different loads
